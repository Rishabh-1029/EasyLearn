# EasyLearn

Working on an **LLM-based chatbot** designed to help learners understand topics at different levels of depth.

## Project Idea
The chatbot allows a learner to enter a topic of their choice.  
Our **LLM (Large Language Model)** then generates study notes at three levels:  

1. **Easy to Learn** – Simplified notes for quick understanding.  
2. **Logical Explanation** – Step-by-step reasoning for better clarity.  
3. **Detailed** – In-depth content for advanced learners.  

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, LangChain, FastAPI, Database (flexible choice)  
- **Frontend**: ReactJS  
- *Can add or change technologies according to project requirements.*  

## Goal
To make learning **personalized and adaptive**, catering to beginners, intermediates, and advanced learners, all in one platform.
